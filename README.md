# odin-recipes
My first project was to make a recipe page.  

I made a homepage of index.html and 3 recipe pages that I linked in the homepage as an unordered list.  The recipe pages each include a title, image, ingredients in an unordered list and steps to the recipe in an ordered list.

I typed out the boilerplate each time to practice. 

In the index, I was able to link to several other pages.  

Other skills demonstrated include use of differently sized headings, adding an image off the web to my page, and knowing how and when to use ordered versus unordered lists.
